Below is a literal, line-by-line “tour” of `share_direction`.  
I first state the overall goal, then walk through every block exactly as the function executes.

──────────────────────────────────  
High-level purpose
──────────────────────────────────  
A “MultiTensor system” is a dictionary-like container that holds many tensors, one for each
combination of five possible axes  
(examples, colour, direction, x, y).  
`share_direction` lets those tensors talk to each other:

• “share up” (`direction = 1`): a finer tensor receives information from all coarser (lower–rank)
  tensors that are nested inside it.  
• “share down” (`direction = –1`): a coarser tensor receives information from all finer
  tensors that cover it.

Before communicating, every tensor is projected down to a small channel size
(cheap to move around); afterwards it is projected back up and added to the residual stream.
The operation is therefore:

    residual →
      down-project  →  cross-tensor aggregation  →  post-norm  →  up-project  →  + residual

──────────────────────────────────  
Step-by-step walk-through
──────────────────────────────────  

1. Function signature / docstring  
```python
def share_direction(residual, share_weights, direction):
```
• `residual` – MultiTensor[Tensor] holding the current residual stream.  
• `share_weights` – for every tensor, a pair `[down_W, up_W]` of linear weights.  
• `direction` – `1` (“up”) or `-1` (“down”).

2. Split the weight bundle into “down” and “up” weight MultiTensors  
```python
down_project_weights = multitensor_systems.multify(lambda d,w: w[0])(share_weights)
up_project_weights   = multitensor_systems.multify(lambda d,w: w[1])(share_weights)
```
`multify` iterates over all tensors; for each `dims` it extracts `weights[0]`
(the first element) or `weights[1]`.

3. Convenience handle on the system object  
```python
multitensor_system = residual.multitensor_system
```
Gives access to the list of dimension-keys and the associated Task object.

4. Down-project every tensor to a smaller channel width  
```python
x = affine(residual, down_project_weights, use_bias=False)
```
`affine` is just `torch.matmul` along the channel dimension.

5. Build the *aggregation* function `share`  
   - we define it differently for “up” vs “down”.

   5 a. Direction == 1  (share *up*):  
   ```python
   def share(dims, _):
       lower_xs = []
       for lower_dims in multitensor_system:
           if all(lower_n ≤ n for lower_n,n in zip(lower_dims, dims)):
               lower_x = x[lower_dims]
               # broadcast missing axes
               for dim,(lower_n,n) in enumerate(zip(lower_dims,dims)):
                   if lower_n < n:
                       axis = sum(dims[:dim],0)     # where that axis lives in the tensor
                       lower_x = torch.unsqueeze(lower_x, axis)
               lower_xs.append(lower_x)
       return sum(lower_xs)
   ```
   • For the current tensor `dims`, gather every tensor whose tuple is
     component-wise ≤ `dims` (“coarser or equal”).  
   • Any missing spatial/colour/direction axes are unsqueezed so the shapes match.  
   • Sum them all.

   5 b. Direction == –1 (share *down*):  
   ```python
   def share(dims, _):
       higher_xs = []
       for higher_dims in multitensor_system:
           if all(higher_n ≥ n for higher_n,n in zip(higher_dims, dims)):
               higher_x = x[higher_dims]
               # collapse extra axes until shape matches `dims`
               for dim,(higher_n,n) in reversed(list(enumerate(zip(higher_dims,dims)))):
                   if higher_n > n:
                       axis = sum(higher_dims[:dim], 0)
                       if special-case for x or y axis with irregular sizes:
                           # compute masked mean so we ignore padding
                           higher_x = masked_average(higher_x, masks, axis)
                       else:
                           higher_x = torch.mean(higher_x, dim=axis)
               higher_xs.append(higher_x)
       return sum(higher_xs)
   ```
   • Collect tensors whose tuple is ≥ `dims` (“finer or equal”).  
   • For each extra axis they possess, average (or masked-average) over that axis
     so the resulting tensor matches the rank/shape of the current one.  
   • Sum the results.

6. Apply the aggregation to every tensor in one shot  
```python
x = multitensor_systems.multify(share)(x)
```
`multify` maps `share` over all `dims` keys and stitches the outputs back
into a new MultiTensor.

7. Post-normalisation  
```python
x = normalize(x)          # variance-1, zero-mean per channel
```

8. Up-project back to the original channel width  
```python
x = affine(x, up_project_weights, use_bias=False)
```

9. Add the communication result to the residual stream  
```python
residual = multitensor_systems.multify(lambda d,a,b: a+b)(residual, x)
```
Effectively `residual[dims] += x[dims]` for every tensor.

10. Return the updated residual  
```python
return residual
```

──────────────────────────────────  
Key take-aways
──────────────────────────────────  
• The layer is analogous to attention across tensors: *down-project → aggregate →
  up-project → residual add*.  
• “Up” sharing pushes information from small/low-rank tensors to bigger/high-rank ones;  
  “Down” sharing does the converse.  
• Unsqueeze vs. mean reduces or expands shapes so that tensors of different ranks can
  be combined without explicit broadcasting errors.  
• Special masking logic ensures that when x/y shapes differ across examples
  the averages respect “in-bounds” pixels only.

That’s the full path every sample takes through `share_direction`.

```python
def share_direction(residual, share_weights, direction):
```

```python
down_project_weights = multitensor_systems.multify(lambda d,w: w[0])(share_weights)
up_project_weights   = multitensor_systems.multify(lambda d,w: w[1])(share_weights)
```

```python
multitensor_system = residual.multitensor_system
```

```python
x = affine(residual, down_project_weights, use_bias=False)
```

```python
   def share(dims, _):
       lower_xs = []
       for lower_dims in multitensor_system:
           if all(lower_n ≤ n for lower_n,n in zip(lower_dims, dims)):
               lower_x = x[lower_dims]
               # broadcast missing axes
               for dim,(lower_n,n) in enumerate(zip(lower_dims,dims)):
                   if lower_n < n:
                       axis = sum(dims[:dim],0)     # where that axis lives in the tensor
                       lower_x = torch.unsqueeze(lower_x, axis)
               lower_xs.append(lower_x)
       return sum(lower_xs)
```

```python
   def share(dims, _):
       higher_xs = []
       for higher_dims in multitensor_system:
           if all(higher_n ≥ n for higher_n,n in zip(higher_dims, dims)):
               higher_x = x[higher_dims]
               # collapse extra axes until shape matches `dims`
               for dim,(higher_n,n) in reversed(list(enumerate(zip(higher_dims,dims)))):
                   if higher_n > n:
                       axis = sum(higher_dims[:dim], 0)
                       if special-case for x or y axis with irregular sizes:
                           # compute masked mean so we ignore padding
                           higher_x = masked_average(higher_x, masks, axis)
                       else:
                           higher_x = torch.mean(higher_x, dim=axis)
               higher_xs.append(higher_x)
       return sum(higher_xs)
```

```python
x = multitensor_systems.multify(share)(x)
```

```python
x = normalize(x)          # variance-1, zero-mean per channel
```

```python
x = affine(x, up_project_weights, use_bias=False)
```

```python
residual = multitensor_systems.multify(lambda d,a,b: a+b)(residual, x)
```

```python

Below is a microscopic, line-by-line explanation of the inner helper called ​`share` that lives inside `share_direction`.  
Two different versions of `share` are defined – one for “sharing ↑-ward” (`direction == 1`) and one for “sharing ↓-ward” (`direction == –1`).  
I’ll treat them separately, then point out what they have in common.

──────────────────────────────  
Background: what are `dims` and `higher_dims` / `lower_dims`?
──────────────────────────────  
• A MultiTensor system indexes every tensor by a 5-tuple

    (examples, colour, direction, x, y)

  Each entry is the *number of axes* the tensor *keeps* for that attribute (0 = axis absent, 1 = axis present).  
  Example: `(1,0,1,1,1)` means “keep example axis, **drop colour**, keep direction/x/y”.  
•  A tensor with tuple  `(1,0,1,1,1)` can be considered “lower” (coarser) than one with `(1,1,1,1,1)` because it has *no colour axis*.

──────────────────────────────  
A.  share-UP (​`direction == 1`)
──────────────────────────────  
Goal: for each current tensor `dims`, gather information from every *lower-or-equal* tensor
and sum it.

```python
def share(dims, _):              # _ is a dummy placeholder required by multify
    lower_xs = []
    for lower_dims in multitensor_system:          # iterate over all tensor keys
        if all(lower_n <= n for lower_n,n in zip(lower_dims, dims)):
            # ―――► the candidate really IS lower-or-equal
            lower_x = x[lower_dims]                # pick its already down-projected version
            # Broadcast it so its rank matches x[dims]
            for dim,(low_n,n) in enumerate(zip(lower_dims, dims)):
                if low_n < n:                      # axis missing → need to insert a length-1 dimension
                    axis = sum(dims[:dim], 0)      # physical index of that axis in the tensor
                    lower_x = torch.unsqueeze(lower_x, axis)
            lower_xs.append(lower_x)
    return sum(lower_xs)
```

Key points  
1. `all(lower_n ≤ n …)` performs a component-wise check.  
2. When `lower_x` lacks an axis owned by the target tensor, `torch.unsqueeze`
   inserts a singleton dimension *exactly where that axis would live* (computed by
   `axis = sum(dims[:dim])`).  
   • Example: target `(1,1,1,1,1)` vs source `(1,0,1,1,1)` (no colour).  
     Colour is the 2nd logical axis (`dim == 1` because 0-based counting).  
     `sum(dims[:1]) = 1`, so unsqueeze at real dimension 1.  
3. After shape alignment, all matching tensors are element-wise *summed*.

──────────────────────────────  
B.  share-DOWN (​`direction == –1`)
──────────────────────────────  
Goal: for each current tensor `dims`, pull information from every *higher-or-equal*
tensor and *reduce* their surplus axes until shapes match, then sum.

```python
def share(dims, _):
    higher_xs = []
    for higher_dims in multitensor_system:
        if all(higher_n >= n for higher_n,n in zip(higher_dims, dims)):
            higher_x = x[higher_dims]                       # already down-projected
            # Collapse extra axes one by one, *from right to left*
            for dim,(high_n,n) in reversed(list(enumerate(zip(higher_dims, dims)))):
                if high_n > n:                              # surplus axis exists
                    axis = sum(higher_dims[:dim], 0)        # real axis index
                    if special-case for x or y axis (dim==3 or dim==4) AND
                       task demands identical output size:
                        # Use MASKED AVERAGE so padding pixels don't bias the mean
                        masks = x.multitensor_system.task.masks
                        masks = 1 - (1-masks[...,0])*(1-masks[...,1])  # union of in/out
                        # replicate mask across colour + direction axes so shapes align
                        for _ in range(sum(higher_dims[1:3])):
                            masks = masks[:, None, ...]
                        # handle the situation where target tensor dropped x or y axis
                        if dims[4]==0 and dim==3:           # dropping y later, so cut y from mask
                            masks = masks[...,0]
                        if higher_dims[3]==0 and dim==4:    # mask adjustment for missing x
                            masks = masks[...,0,:]
                        masks = masks[...,None]             # add channel dim
                        higher_x = torch.sum(higher_x*masks, dim=axis) / \
                                   (torch.sum(masks, dim=axis) + 1e-4)
                    else:
                        higher_x = torch.mean(higher_x, dim=axis)
            higher_xs.append(higher_x)
    return sum(higher_xs)
```

Detailed mechanics  
1. The reversed enumeration ensures we squeeze *trailing* logical axes first, so
   earlier axis indices stay valid.  
2. The special handling for `dim == 3` (x axis) or `dim == 4` (y axis) is needed
   when the ARC task treats input and output canvases as “same size”.  
   • The `task.masks` tensor marks in-bounds pixels for **both** input and output.  
   • The expression `1 - (1–mask_in)·(1–mask_out)` gives the union mask.  
   • Channel/colour/direction axes are broadcasted by inserting `None` dims.  
   • The masked average ignores padded zeros and divides by
     `sum(mask) + ε`.  
3. For non-special axes (colour, direction) or when the task is not “same size”,
   a plain `torch.mean` suffices.  
4. After *all* extra axes are reduced, the tensor shape now matches the target
   tensor’s shape; accumulate into the `higher_xs` list and finally `sum`.

──────────────────────────────  
Common structure
──────────────────────────────  
• Both variants iterate over *all* keys in the system.  
• They gate each candidate by a component-wise ≤ or ≥ test.  
• They perform shape-alignment (unsqueeze or reduce) so broadcasting is legal.  
• They output the *sum* of all aligned tensors.

──────────────────────────────  
Why unsqueeze left-to-right but reduce right-to-left?
──────────────────────────────  
Removing an axis *changes all subsequent axis indices*.  
Iterating from the right (highest logical dim) avoids re-computing indices after
each squeeze. Adding axes (unsqueeze) does not shift those already processed,
so left-to-right is fine.

──────────────────────────────  
Effect on information flow
──────────────────────────────  
• share-UP: propagates **coarse** representations (few axes) upwards to richer ones.  
• share-DOWN: propagates **fine** spatial/colour information down into coarser
  tensors, averaging where necessary.  
Together, alternating up and down passes resembles multiscale message passing or a
U-Net / FPN-style bidirectional fusion, but in a fully general tensor lattice.

```python

    for lower_dims in multitensor_system:          # iterate over all tensor keys
        if all(lower_n <= n for lower_n,n in zip(lower_dims, dims)):
            # ―――► the candidate really IS lower-or-equal
            lower_x = x[lower_dims]                # pick its already down-projected version
            # Broadcast it so its rank matches x[dims]
