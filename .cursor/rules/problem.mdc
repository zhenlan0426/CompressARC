**Problem:**  
The goal is to solve the ARC AGI benchmark. Each task consists of a sequence of input-output pairs:  
\[(\text{input}_1, \text{output}_1), (\text{input}_2, \text{output}_2), \dots, (\text{input}_N, \text{output}_N)\],  
where each input and output is a 2D grid of integers in the range \([0, 9]\).  
Given all previous input-output examples up to \(\text{input}_N\), the objective is to predict \(\text{output}_N\).  
The model will be evaluated on previously unseen test tasks.
