`make_directional_layer` is a higher-order factory: it takes two “primitive” directional operators that work on plain 4-D or 5-D tensors (`fn` for the four cardinal directions, `diagonal_fn` for the two diagonals) and lifts them into a new operator that can run inside the model’s rich “multitensor” layout, where one of the axes encodes direction.

Below is a line-by-line walk-through.  The citation spans the whole definition so you can follow along while reading the explanation.

```152:224:layers.py
def make_directional_layer(fn, diagonal_fn):
    ...
```

1. Purpose & signature  
   • `fn(x, dim, masks)` — expects to do something (e.g. `cummax_`, `shift_`) **along a single spatial axis** `dim` of `x`.  
   • `diagonal_fn(x, dim1, dim2, masks)` — same idea, but acts along the two-axis diagonals.  
   The factory returns `directional_layer`: a function that can now accept tensors whose **direction axis is explicit** and apply the correct primitive to each slice.

2. Pre-processing of the input masks (ll. 162-176)  
   The network stores a `(example, x, y, in/out)` boolean mask telling which pixels belong to the puzzle grid versus padding.  
   • First, any pixel that is out of bounds in *either* the input or the target (“in/out”) is turned off.  
   • Then the mask is expanded / contracted so it lines up with the tensor `x` under the current multitensor shape `dims`.  
   • Finally, the data in `x` is *masked*, i.e. out-of-bounds positions are zeroed so later cumulative ops ignore them.

3. Book-keeping about where the direction axis lives (ll. 179-184)  
   • `n_directions = dims[3] + dims[4]` is 4 or 8 depending on whether we include diagonals.  
   • `direction_dim = sum(dims[:2])` counts how many axes (example, colour, …) appear before the direction axis so we know its index in the raw PyTorch tensor.

4. `zero_tensor` sentinel (l. 186)  
   Used when the requested direction (e.g. diagonals on a tensor that only has straight directions) is absent; we then return an all-zeros slice so shapes still line up.

5. Double split on channel & direction halves (ll. 190-220)  
   The model encodes both “forward/backward” *and* “direction index” inside the direction and the channel axes, so the nested loops iterate over:  
   • `channel_split ∈ {0,1}` → use even or odd channels; one half is processed forward, the other backward.  
   • `direction_split ∈ {0,1}` → which half of the direction axis we are working on (0 = forward, 1 = backward).  
   • `direction_ind  ∈ {0…3}` → actual direction: 0=+x, 1=+x+​y, 2=+y, 3=+y-x.

   For each combination we:
   a. Pick out the slice `x_slice` for that direction/chunk.  
   b. If it is a *cardinal* direction (`direction_ind` even), call `fn`.  
      - We may flip the tensor before and after the call to reuse the same primitive for the “backward” scan.  
   c. If it is a *diagonal* direction (`direction_ind` odd), call `diagonal_fn` with the two spatial dims.  
      - Again, various flips are applied so one kernel works for four diagonals.  
   d. Collect the results.

6. Reconstruction (ll. 221-223)  
   • First stack on the direction axis (`torch.stack`) to put the eight direction slices back together for this half-channel-split.  
   • Then concatenate on the channel axis (`torch.cat`) to reunite the two channel halves into the final output.

7. Returned object  
   The function finally returns `directional_layer`, which conforms to the “multified” API: it takes `(dims, x, masks)` and can be decorated with `@multitensor_systems.multify`, `add_residual`, etc.  
   In the file you can see it being used twice: once to build `cummax` and once to build `shift`, letting those two low-level operations automatically broadcast over any tensor shape that contains a direction dimension.

Why the elaborate splitting/​flipping?  
• **Weight sharing** – by flipping, the same primitive kernel computes both forward and backward scans, reducing code & parameters.  
• **Diagonal reuse** – `diagonal_fn` is written for one of the two diagonals; flips extend it to all four.  
• **Shape safety** – the function never assumes the presence of x- or y-axes; if they are missing it substitutes zeros so tensor ranks always match.

Potential pitfalls & design comments  
• The nested loops create Python-level overhead; if this layer becomes a bottleneck, you might fuse the logic into a vectorised operation or a custom CUDA kernel.  
• Extensive `torch.flip` calls allocate views but still cost time; benchmarking different flip strategies could be valuable.  
• The masking logic treats out-of-bounds pixels by zeroing the *data*; some directional aggregations (e.g. max) later add very large penalties (`±1e3`) instead—maintaining a single consistent “masked value convention” may simplify reasoning and guard against subtle numeric bugs.

Overall, `make_directional_layer` turns any 1-D/diagonal scan primitive into a robust high-level layer that respects ARC puzzle boundaries and the architecture’s rich tensor shape scheme.
